# Regex Learning Introduction!
Welcome to a brief introductory guide to learning Regex! We'll be quickly diving into the world of Regex, or as it's fully called, Regular Expression. Regular Expression allows a user or program to search with finer, or more specific, detail. Like google search will respond with the words you've type, Regex can be far more particular and precise! 

## Summary
Here we'll take a quick example of a search for an email-matching Regex! It may seem confusing, at first, but by the end of this small tutorial you'll be able to recognize nearly all aspects of Regular Expressions! 

* Matching an Email: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

## Regex Components

### Anchors
* The anchor component of a Regular Expression are the characters which start and end the string. 
* As we begin the Regex (a literal) it must be encased in `/ /` to denote the expression. 
* Afterwards is when the Anchors come into play. The ^ character, and $ character are our wrapping anchors.
* Anything that comes after our ^ will be recognized as the literal, and you will close that string with the $ character.
* Exaggerated look to see where these characters sit: `/  ^   ([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})   $  /`
* Failure to do so may result in your whole file laced with red errors!
